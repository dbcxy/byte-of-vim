# A Byte of Vim

"A Byte of Vim" is a book which aims to help you to learn how to use the [Vim editor](http://www.vim.org) (version 7), even if all you know is how to use the computer keyboard.

The first part of this book is meant for new users who want to understand what Vim is and learn how to use it.

The second part of this book is for people who already know how to use Vim and want to learn about features that make Vim so powerful, such as windows and tabs, personal information management, making it a programmer's editor, how to extend Vim with your own plugins, and more.

> Awesome! Thank you for all of your hard work. It is especially nice that the beginning starts the reader off gradually. After using vim for a couple of years I've forgotten how weird it seems at first, so I probably wouldn't explain it that good to someone. I will be sure to share your book to spread the vim propaganda. ;-)

> What I am trying to say is if you have basic computer competency you should immediately get Vim on your machine and improve your life. The best place to learn about is to read Swaroop C H's awesome eBook A Byte of Vim, it will revolutionize how you think about text editors in the future.

> What a nice book. I'm a long-time vim user, but never managed to get my head around vim scripting (apart from fixing some bugs in others' scripts). This is the best introduction to Vim scripting (writing plugins, syntax files, ...) I have seen so far. Thanks for putting it online!

> I have used vi for quite a while and am pretty comfortable with it. But all I do in vi is first get into insert mode and edit the file as if I am using notepad. I started searching for tutorials on vi and found one that is so simple yet so amazing. I thank Swaroop CH, yes the same guy who wrote the book A Byte of Python, for another amazing book A Byte of Vim. It was so amazing and I started using vi like a novice vimmer.
